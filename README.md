##General 
Git repository createad for the Real-time system subject at the University of South-Eastern Norway with the task of creating a real-time system ourselves. Our goal was to create a self-driving mecaunm car that would never crash and could also be remote controlled. Our system would detect the objects that may come in the way by using ultrasonic sensores and making a decision based on their data.
